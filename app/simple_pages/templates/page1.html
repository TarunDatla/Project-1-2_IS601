                <span style="color:black;font-weight:bold;size:B5">Git Branch - </span> A branch represents an
                independent line
                of development. Branches serve as an abstraction for the edit/stage/commit process. You can think of
                them as a way to request a brand-new working directory, staging area, and project history. New commits
                are recorded in the history for the current branch, which results in a fork in the history of the
                project.

                <span style="color:black;font-weight:bold;size:B5">Git Merge - </span> Git merge will combine multiple
                sequences of commits into one unified history. In the most frequent use cases, git merge is used to
                combine two branches. The following examples in this document will focus on this branch merging pattern.
                In these scenarios, git merge takes two commit pointers,
                usually the branch tips, and will find a common base commit between them. Once Git finds a common base
                commit it will create a new "merge commit" that combines the changes of each queued merge commit
                sequence.
                Say we have a new branch feature that is based off the main branch. We now want to merge this feature
                branch into main.Invoking this command will merge the specified branch feature into the current branch,
                we'll assume main. Git will determine the merge algorithm automatically
                Merge commits are unique against other commits in the fact that they have two parent commits. When
                creating a merge commit Git will attempt to auto magically merge the separate histories for you. If Git
                encounters a piece of data that is changed in both histories it will be unable to automatically combine
                them. This scenario is a version control conflict and Git will need user intervention to continue.

                <span style="color:black;font-weight:bold;size:B5">Git Commit - </span> At a high level, Git can be
                thought of as a timeline management utility. Commits are the
                core building block units of a Git project timeline. Commits can be thought of as snapshots or
                milestones along the timeline of a Git project. Commits are created with the git commit command to
                capture the state of a project at that point in time. Git Snapshots are always committed to the local
                repository. This is fundamentally different from SVN, wherein the working copy is committed to the
                central repository. In contrast, Git doesn’t force you to interact with the central repository until
                you’re ready. Just as the staging area is a buffer between the working directory and the project
                history, each developer’s local repository is a buffer between their contributions and the central
                repository.This changes the basic development model for Git users. Instead of making a change and
                committing it directly to the central repo, Git developers have the opportunity to accumulate commits in
                their local repo. This has many advantages over SVN-style collaboration: it makes it easier to split up
                a feature into atomic commits, keep related commits grouped together, and clean up local history before
                publishing it to the central repository. It also lets developers work in an isolated environment,
                deferring integration until they’re at a convenient point to merge with other users. While isolation and
                deferred integration are individually beneficial, it is in a team's best interest to integrate
                frequently and in small units. For more information regarding best practices for Git team collaboration
                read how teams structure their Git workflow.

                <span style="color:black;font-weight:bold;size:B5">Git Tag - </span> Tags are ref's that point to
                specific points in Git history. Tagging is generally used to
                capture a point in history that is used for a marked version release (i.e. v1.0.1). A tag is like a
                branch that doesn’t change. Unlike branches, tags, after being created, have no further history of
                commits. For more info on branches visit the git branch page. This document will cover the different
                kind of tags, how to create tags, listing all tags, deleting tags, sharing tags, and more.

                <span style="color:black;font-weight:bold;size:B5">Git Repository - </span> Repositories in GIT contain
                a collection of files of various different versions of a
                Project. These files are imported from the repository into the local server of the user for further
                updations and modifications in the content of the file. A VCS or the Version Control System is used to
                create these versions and store them in a specific place termed as a repository. The process of copying
                the content from an existing Git Repository with the help of various Git Tools is termed as cloning.
                Once the cloning process is done, the user gets the complete repository on his local machine. Git by
                default assumes the work to be done on the repository is as a user, once the cloning is done.
                Users can also create a new repository or delete an existing repository. To delete a repository, the
                simpler way is to just delete the folder containing the repository.
