                <span style="color:black;font-weight:bold;size:B5">Docker Container - </span> A container is a standard
                unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies, so the application runs quickly and
                reliably from one computing environment to another. A Docker container image is a lightweight,
                standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code,
                runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.
                Container images become containers at runtime and in the case of Docker containers - images become
                containers when they run on Docker Engine. Available for both Linux and Windows-based applications,
                containerized software will always run the same, regardless of the infrastructure. Containers isolate
                software from its environment and ensure that it works uniformly despite differences for instance
                between development and staging

            <p>
                <span style="color:black;font-weight:bold;size:B5">Docker images - </span> The default docker images
                will show all top level images, their repository and tags, and their size.
                Docker images have intermediate layers that increase reusability, decrease disk usage, and speed up
                docker build by allowing each step to be cached. These intermediate layers are not shown by default.
                The SIZE is the cumulative space taken up by the image and all its parent images. This is also the disk
                space used by the contents of the Tar file created when you docker save an image.
                An image will be listed more than once if it has multiple repository names or tags. This single image
                (identifiable by its matching IMAGE ID) uses up the SIZE listed only once.

                1.	docker pull <imagename> - This command is used to pull the images from the docker repository .<br>

                2.	docker run -it -d <imagename> - This command is used to create acontainer from an image<br>

                3.	docker ps – This command is used to show up the list of running commands.<br>

                4.	docker exec -it <containerid> bash – This command is used top access the running container<br>

                5.	docker stop <containerid> This command is used to stop a running container.<br>

                6.	docker kill <containerid> - This command stops the execution of the current executing container. The difference between the docker stop and docker kill command is docker stop gives the container time to shutdown, when a container is taking too much time to stop then you can choose kill.<br>

                7.	docker commit <containerid><username/imagename> - This command creates a new image of an edited container on the local system.<br>

                8.	docker push <username/imagename> - This command is used to push an image to docker hub repository.<br>

                9.	docker login – This command is used to login into your docker hub repository<br>

                10.	docker push <username/imagename> - This command is used to push an image to the docker hub repository<br>

                11.	docker images – It is used to list all the images (docker images) stored<br>

                12.	docker rm <containerid> - This command is used to delete a stopped container.<br>

                13.	docker build prune – This command is used for clearing the cache<br>
