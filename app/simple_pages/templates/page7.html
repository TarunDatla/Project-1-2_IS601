                <span style="color:black;font-weight:bold;size:B5">Encapsulation - </span> Encapsulation is a way to
                ensure security. Basically, it hides the data from the access of outsiders. Such as if an organization
                wants to protect an object/information from unwanted access by clients or any unauthorized person then
                encapsulation is the way to ensure this. You can declare the methods or the attributes protected by
                using a single underscore ( _ ) before their names. Such as- self._name or def _method( ); Both of these
                lines tell that the attribute and method are protected and should not be used outside the access of the
                class and sub-classes but can be accessed by class methods and objects. Though Python uses ‘ _ ‘ just as
                a coding convention, it tells that you should use these attributes/methods within the scope of the
                class. But you can still access the variables and methods which are defined as protected, as usual. Now
                for actually preventing the access of attributes/methods from outside the scope of a class, you can use
                “private members“. In order to declare the attributes/method as private members, use double underscore (
                __ ) in the prefix. Such as – self.__name or def __method(); Both of these lines tell that the attribute
                and method are private and access is not possible from outside the class.<br>
                Here if we see the above figure we observe that "test_calculation_multiplication" method is accessing
                the encapsulated method. So it created the object of the class and calling the method by class
                name<br><br>

            <p class="col-8">
                <span style="color:black;font-weight:bold;size:B5">Inheritance - </span> Inheritance is the procedure in
                which one class inherits the attributes and methods of another class. The class whose properties and
                methods are inherited is known as Parent class. And the class that inherits the properties from the
                parent class is the Child class. The interesting thing is, along with the inherited properties and
                methods, a child class can have its own properties and methods.<br>
                from the above figure we can see that class "calculation" is parent class and class "addition is child
                class" addition is inheriting the features of calculation class so that it can use its methods and
                variables<br><br>

                <span style="color:black;font-weight:bold;size:B5">Polymorphism (OVERLOADING) - </span> Methods in
                Python can be called with zero, one, or more parameters. This process of calling the same method in
                different ways is called method overloading. It is one of the important concepts in OOP. Two methods
                cannot have the same name in Python; hence method overloading is a feature that allows the same operator
                to have different meanings. Overloading is a method or operator that can do different functionalities
                with the same name. Advantages of method overloading in python reduces complexities improves the quality
                of the code is also used for reusability and easy accessibility<br>
                Here in the above figure if we observe "get_last_calculation_result()" is accessed multiple times in
                different methods for different functionality i.e method "add_number()" is using it to save the added
                data of the last calculation and "subtract_number" is using to save the subtracted data of the last
                calculation. they are using the same method for their purposes<br><br>

                <span style="color:black;font-weight:bold;size:B5">Polymorphism (OVERRIDING) </span> Method overriding
                is an ability of any object-oriented programming language that allows a subclass or child class to
                provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by one of its super-classes or
                parent classes. When a method in a subclass has the same name, same parameters or signature and same
                return type(or sub-type) as a method in its super-class, then the method in the subclass is said to
                override the method in the super-class. The version of a method that is executed will be determined by
                the object that is used to invoke it. If an object of a parent class is used to invoke the method, then
                the version in the parent class will be executed, but if an object of the subclass is used to invoke the
                method, then the version in the child class will be executed. In other words, it is the type of the
                object being referred to (not the type of the reference variable) that determines which version of an
                overridden method will be executed.<br>
                If you observe the above figure get_result() which is class "claculation's" method is inherited by the
                child classes "division" and "multiplication" and they implement the same method in different ways they
                are overriding the methods and using them in their way. class "division" is returning the divided result
                and class "multiplication" is returning the multiplied result<br><br>

                <span style="color:black;font-weight:bold;size:B5">Abstraction - </span> Abstraction in Python
                Abstraction is used to hide the internal functionality of the function from the users. The users only
                interact with the basic implementation of the function, but inner working is hidden. User is familiar
                with that "what function does" but they don't know "how it does." In simple words, we all use the
                smartphone and very much familiar with its functions such as camera, voice-recorder, call-dialing, etc.,
                but we don't know how these operations are happening in the background. Let's take another example -
                When we use the TV remote to increase the volume. We don't know how pressing a key increases the volume
                of the TV. We only know to press the "+" button to increase the volume. That is exactly the abstraction
                that works in the object-oriented concept. Why Abstraction is Important? In Python, an abstraction is
                used to hide the irrelevant data/class in order to reduce the complexity. It also enhances the
                application efficiency. Next, we will learn how we can achieve abstraction using the Python program.<br><br>
